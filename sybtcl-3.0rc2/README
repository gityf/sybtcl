WHAT IS SYBTCL?

Sybtcl is an extension to Tool Command Language (Tcl) that provides access
to a Sybase Database server.  Sybtcl adds additional Tcl commands that 
login to a SQL Server, pass SQL code, read results, etc.  Sybtcl was inspired
by similar tools written for Perl (sybperl, oraperl) but was written from
scratch instead of borrowing on the work of either Perl extension.

Sybtcl features:
  -supports multiple connections to the same or different SQL Servers
  -provides "nextrow" processing for regular and compute return rows
  -converts results to strings and returns rows as Tcl lists
  -allows user defined null values to be returned
  -stored procedures can be executed and return values accessed
  -accesses column names, lengths, and datatypes of rows & return values
  -provides feedback of SQL Server and DB-Lib messages
  -reads/writes text or image datatypes to files or variables
  -asynchronous queries with either polling or event processing


Sybtcl does not:
  -perform row buffering or browse mode
  -bulk copies
  -support two phase commit on multiple servers
  

WHERE TO GET SYBTCL

http://sybtcl.sourceforge.net/

And additionally from the Neosoft site:
	
ftp://ftp.neosoft.com/pub/tcl/sorted/databases/sybtcl-3.0/
or

HOW TO BUILD SYBTCL

See the INSTALL file for instructions on how to build sybtcl from source.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

	John Ousterhout (john.ousterhout@scriptics.com) for Tcl and Tk -
	    wonderful software in my opinion.

	Karl Lehenbauer (karl@NeoSoft.com) and 
	    Mark Diekhans (markd@Grizzly.com) for Extended Tcl -
	    more good stuff.

	Michael Peppler (mpeppler@datamig.com) for sybperl, which gave me
	    the inspiration to write Sybtcl.  


REQUIREMENTS

Since Sybtcl is an extension to Tcl, you should already have Tcl, or be
prepared to get it via Ftp [sites listed below].

Of course, you must also have access to a Sybase Databaser Server.  
Additionally, you must have the Sybase Open Client (aka "DB-Library") package 
that provides header files and object libraries;  Sybtcl must be linked 
with libsybdb -- typically dynamically as a .dll, .so.

Sybtcl supports building a dynamic load library on
systems that support dynamic loading.  If you build static libraries and
executables, I recommend building with Extended Tcl.

The specific software versions I used:

        Tcl - 8.3.2         http://download.sourceforge.net/tcl/tcl8.3.2.tar.gz
        Tk  - 8.3.2         http://download.sourceforge.net/tcl/tk8.3.2.tar.gz
                            also avaible at
			    http://www.scriptics.com
			    http://www.tcltk.com/
			    http://www.neosoft.com/tcl

        Extended Tcl - 8.2.0  ftp.neosoft.com
                                /pub/tcl/TclX/tclX8.2.0.tar.gz


	Sybase SQL Server - 4.x, System 10, or System 11  
	Sybase Open Client / DB-Lib (CT-Lib in a pinch, see INSTALL)

	see the newsgroup comp.lang.tcl for general Tcl discussion and
	the Tcl Frequently Asked Questions.


I've built Sybtcl in Sequent PTX 1.3 (System V 3.2), SunOS 4.1.x, Solaris 2.5,
Dec Unix, HPUX 9.x/10.x, Linux/ELF (RedHat 5.2), and 
Windows NT 4.0/95/VC++ 4.0, MacOS 8.1/MPW.

Other users have reported successful compiles on: 
SGI Irix
IBM AIX
SCO Unix


LINUX 

You can now get Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise 11.0.3 for *free*,
including the necessary DB-Lib.  Get yours at:
	http://www.sybase.com/linux/ase/
	http://www.redhat.com
	http://www.caldera.com
	http://www.suse.com


WINDOWS NT/95/98/00 AND MACINTOSH

Windows:
A DLL for Windows NT/95 is supplied in the ./win directory. 
Run 'tclsh83 install.tcl' to install.

See the win/README.win file for more information.

Please note!!   I'm not suppling a .zip file for Windows.
                The popular WinZip program can unpack .tar.gz files.  Save the
                distribution file on your Windows machine, 
                using .tgz instead of .tar.gz for best results. 

Windows users must have a Sybase client installation on their machines.
I've built the DLL with Open Client 11.5, but it should build with anything
10.0.3 and higher.  The DLL was compiled with Microsoft VC 4.0.


Macintosh:
[Currently, I have no way to compile a binary for Sybtcl on the Mac
as I do not have a Mac port of OpenClient available, nor a decent MPW 
setup.  If anyone can offer this service, please let me know and I will
be happy to include it in this distro  -=- D. J. <dhagberg@millibits.com>]

Macintosh users must have a Sybase client installation on their machines.
I've built the shared lib with Open Client 10.0.4, using the 'CFM (FAT)'
libraries.  The shared lib can be compiled with Apple's MPW MrC compiler.
You can get Apple MPW for *free* at:
http://www.apple.com/developer
http://developer.apple.com/sdk/index.html

I didn't make a 68k version.  Let me know if you get a 68k version working.


SAMPLES

Some samples are included.

In particular, the "wisqlite" (Windowing ISQL) program 
is a handy replacement for Sybase's Isql in an X11 environment.
Also of special interest is 'sp_who', a graphical version of the Sybase
'sp_who' stored procedure, and 'sybmon', a simple Sybase server monitor.

See ./samples/README.samples plus each file's comments and code.


MAN PAGE

You're in luck! I've written one.  See the ./doc directory for manual pages
in text, html, and postscript.


OTHER DOCUMENTATION

Sybtcl is explained in greater detail in "Tcl/Tk Tools", edited by Mark 
Harrison, and published by O'Reilly and Associates.  "Tcl/Tk Tools" is 
a new book that covers many of the popular Tcl extensions, written by
the authors of each extension (Tom wrote the chapters on Sybtcl and Oratcl.)

BUG REPORTS

Comments, suggestions, et.al., should be mailed to me 
or posted to comp.lang.tcl if general enough nature.

Please ALWAYS INCLUDE:  
	-version of Sybtcl
	-version of Tcl, Tk, and TclX
	-version of Sybase server and DB-Libary
	-version of your operating system
	-switches used with configure (see config.status)

TCL DATABASE MAILING LIST
 
A mailing list is available for specific discussions about using Tcl with
databases, including Oratcl, Sybtcl, etc.  Feel free to join and mail to the
list.  The list is hosted by De Clarke.
 
To subscribe to this list send mail to
 
        listserv@ucolick.org
 
and in the body of the message write
 
        subscribe tcldb
 
To unsubscribe... (well, you get the idea).
 
Please remember to write to tcldb-owner with problems about the
list itself, or to postmaster@ucolick.org if you have difficulties
getting through to the tcldb-owner address.  Please do not send
subscribe and unsubscribe messages to the list itself.


INSTALLATION

Quickie install instructions:

        cd unix
	./configure --prefix=/same/prefix/path/as/with/tcl/configure  \
		    --exec-prefix=/same/exec-prefix/path/as/with/tcl/configure 
	make
	make install
	make install-tools

Didn't work?  You'll have to read the INSTALL file.  Maybe you should read it
anyway.

NOTE!!! I strongly advise that you build Tcl with the '--enable-shared' option.
Sybtcl uses information that Tcl's configure finds, particularly information
about compiling and linking for dynamic shared libraries.  Sybtcl by 
default builds a shared library.  See the INSTALL file for additional notes.


TEST SUITE

A test suite is included.  You will need access to a Sybase server, with
permission to create tables and stored procedures.  You can run the test suite
after building Sybtcl by running:

	make tests


ADDITIONAL APPS

De Clark has built some wonder applications using Sybtcl, including the
feature-rich full version of Wisql.  Visit her site at:

    http://www.ucolick.org/~de/Tcl/

and visit the UCO Lick Tcl/Tk source code link to view and download all
these applications.


OTHER

Try out the Sybtcl C API.  It allows your C programs to access Sybase
using the Sybtcl model. It's experimental; please mail to me if
it works for you, or if you have improvements.  See ./sybtcl-capi/*

See the file CHANGES for changes in versions of Sybtcl.
